# Tag-Yourself

Telegram bot that allows users to make graphs in one, two, or three dimensions
in which you can "tag yourself" by plotting yourself with respect to each axis.

## TODO

everything

## API Key

The api key is stored in API_key.txt but withheld with .gitignore. To replicate this project, make a Telegram bot by messaging \@BotFather and pasting the resulting API key there.
